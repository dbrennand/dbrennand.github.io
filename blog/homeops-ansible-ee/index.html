Back again with another blog post! This time I wanted to discuss some cool changes I&rsquo;ve made in my Homelab to explore AWX and Ansible Execution Environments.
What is AWX?
AWX provides a web interface and REST API for managing and running Ansible content. AWX is the upstream project which Red Hat&rsquo;s commerical offering Ansible Automation Platform&rsquo;s Automation Controller is based on. AWX uses Execution Environments to run Ansible content and is deployed on Kubernetes using the awx-operator."><meta name=author content="Daniel Brennand"><link rel=canonical href=https://dbren.uk/blog/homeops-ansible-ee/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://dbren.uk/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://dbren.uk/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://dbren.uk/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://dbren.uk/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://dbren.uk/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://dbren.uk/blog/homeops-ansible-ee/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://dbren.uk/blog/homeops-ansible-ee/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Daniel Brennand"><meta property="og:title" content="Home-Ops | AWX and Ansible Execution Environments"><meta property="og:description" content="Hey there folks! 👋

This time I wanted to discuss some cool changes I’ve made in my Homelab to explore AWX and Ansible Execution Environments.\nWhat is AWX? AWX provides a web interface and REST API for managing and running Ansible content. AWX is the upstream project which Red Hat’s commerical offering Ansible Automation Platform’s Automation Controller is based on. AWX uses Execution Environments to run Ansible content and is deployed on Kubernetes using the awx-operator.\nWhat is an Execution Environment (EE)? An EE is an OCI compliant container image which contains Python, ansible-core, ansible-runner and other dependencies (Ansible content such as roles, collections and any dependent Python modules). Using EEs helps create a consistent environment every time we run our Ansible content.\nMotivations Before making these changes in my Homelab, I was aware of AWX and EEs but I hadn’t used either of them much, or built my own EE before. I’ve always wanted to use AWX and recent changes in my job have also motivated my use of AWX too.\nBuilding Execution Environments The Ansible development tooling ecosystem has a very handy tool for building EEs called ansible-builder. Ansible builder helps simplify the EE creation process by handling tasks such as including Python modules, Ansible roles and collections, and configuring a certain user and permissions; just to name a few.\nAnsible builder uses a definition file named execution-environment.yml to define the base container image, dependencies and additional build steps for the EE.\nMulti-Arch Execution Environment builds in GitHub Actions In my Home-Ops repository, I use ansible-builder in a GitHub Action Workflow to build my EE and upload it to the GitHub Container Registry. You can pull it now using the command:\ndocker pull ghcr.io/dbrennand/home-ops:latest The image is multi-arch supporting both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 as I use my EE on devices with these CPU architectures. Getting the EE to build for multiple architectures inside a GitHub Action was very trial and error. I searched around online but couldn’t find anyone else building a multi-arch EE with GitHub Actions and ansible-builder.\nThe first error I encountered was:\nERROR: Multi-platform build is not supported for the docker driver. Switch to a different driver, or turn on the containerd image store, and try again. Learn more at https://docs.docker.com/go/build-multi-platform/ I got this error even though I had initialised the workflow with the docker/setup-qemu-action@v3 and docker/setup-buildx-action@v3 actions for multi-arch builds, which I’d done before without any issues. It turns out that I needed to tell ansible-builder to use the name of the builder context created by the docker/setup-buildx-action@v3 action. Furthermore, whilst testing there was another issue where the image built by ansible-builder wasn’t loaded into the Docker daemon.\nTo resolve both these issues I used the --extra-build-cli-args argument with ansible-builder like so:\nansible-builder ... --extra-build-cli-args \"--load --builder ${{ steps.docker_buildx.outputs.name }} --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64\" Once I did the above, the next error I encountered was:\nERROR: docker exporter does not currently support exporting manifest lists From a recently active GitHub issue this wasn’t supported until very recently via an experimental containerd-snapshotter feature on the docker/setup-docker-action@v4 action; so I enabled it:\n- name: Set up Docker uses: docker/setup-docker-action@v4 with: daemon-config: | { \"features\": { \"containerd-snapshotter\": true } } Finally, I had multi-arch builds of my EE in GitHub Actions working! Woo! 🎉 😄\nUsing the Execution Environment I’m using the EE on my Macbook with ansible-navigator and AWX. I’ve written a little more about this here.\nAs most of my playbooks use the community.general.onepassword lookup plugin to pull secrets from a 1Password vault, I’ve included the op CLI in my EE.\nTo start the EE and authenticate the op CLI I run the following commands in my Home-Ops repository:\ncd ansible export ONEPASSWORD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=op://Vault/ServiceAccount/token op run -- ansible-navigator exec -- /bin/bash The 1Password application on my Macbook then prompts for my fingerprint via Touch ID to authorise retrieval of the Service Account token. Pretty 🆒 😎\nIn AWX I’ve registered the EE for use in Job Templates using an Ansible playbook. To authenticate the op CLI in the EE running on AWX, I also create a custom credential type which I then use in my Job Templates. I’ll probably make another blog post expanding on this a little more soon! So stay tuned for that one! 🙂\nThat’s all for this one folks! Until next time! 👋\n","wordCount":"725","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-05-16T15:08:18+01:00","dateModified":"2025-05-16T15:08:18+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Daniel Brennand"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://dbren.uk/blog/homeops-ansible-ee/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Daniel Brennand","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://dbren.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://dbren.uk/ accesskey=h title="Daniel Brennand (Alt + H)">Daniel Brennand</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://dbren.uk/blog title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://dbren.uk/search title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://dbren.uk/tags title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://dbren.uk/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://dbren.uk/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://dbren.uk/blog/>Blogs</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Home-Ops | AWX and Ansible Execution Environments</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-05-16 15:08:18 +0100 +0100'>May 16, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;725 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Daniel Brennand</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#what-is-awx aria-label="What is AWX?">What is AWX?</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-an-execution-environment-ee aria-label="What is an Execution Environment (EE)?">What is an Execution Environment (EE)?</a></li><li><a href=#motivations aria-label=Motivations>Motivations</a></li><li><a href=#building-execution-environments aria-label="Building Execution Environments">Building Execution Environments</a><ul><li><a href=#multi-arch-execution-environment-builds-in-github-actions aria-label="Multi-Arch Execution Environment builds in GitHub Actions">Multi-Arch Execution Environment builds in GitHub Actions</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#using-the-execution-environment aria-label="Using the Execution Environment">Using the Execution Environment</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Hey there folks! 👋</p><p>Back again with another blog post!
