I had an awesome time at the Ansible Meetup in London on the 21st of November 2024. The meetup was attended by around 25 people and was hosted at the Dell Technologies offices in London. The meetup was sponsored by Red Hat and Krameff Solutions.

I did my first ever talk at a meetup titled: *Infrastructure as Code - VPS provisioning and configuration on Hetzner Cloud*. Hetzner is a public cloud provider I've used for personal projects and in my Homelab. I've been really impressed with their service and the value for money they offer. As part of my talk, I did a live demo of deploying a Virtual Private Server (VPS) and configuring a NGINX web server on the VPS using Ansible. The talk went really well and there was a some great Q&A with the audience :smile:

My [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18f6QWzNo8xsUDzsOZBH93LyyM5nkElS-QoM4iL_wY8U/edit?usp=sharing) and the Ansible content I wrote for the demo is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dbrennand/demos/tree/main/ansible/meetup-nov-21).

I really enjoyed giving the talk and I'm looking forward to doing more in the future. I'm also looking forward to attending more meetups as it was great to speak with others who are passionate about Ansible and automation :smile: The pizza and drinks were great too! :pizza: :beer:

I'd like to say a big thank you to the organisers for making it happen and to everyone who attended. I'm looking forward to the next one! :tada:
