It was another great [Ansible meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ansible-london/events/307305041/) in London on the 5th June 2025. It was hosted at Metro Bank's offices near Holburn and the attendance was excellent!

I gave a talk titled *Ansible 101 - Getting Started on your Ansible Journey*. The talk was aimed at members of the community who're new to Ansible and just starting their Ansible journey. We covered key terminology and concepts such as: Inventories, Playbooks, Modules and Plugins, Roles, Collections and Ansible Vault.

The [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C8z6MniRU3l4nVBg-yClhrPaI3YvuZVXAUQXPAUru0k/edit?usp=sharing) and the Ansible content I created for the demo are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dbrennand/demos/tree/meetup-may/ansible/meetup-june-5).

Thank you to everyone who asked questions in the Q&A and came up and gave their feedback after the talk :slightly_smiling_face:. The community is amazing, everyone is so friendly and welcoming. I encourage anyone who is on the fence about submitting a talk to give it a go!

Finally, it was a pleasure to present alongside [James Freeman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesfreeman959/?originalSubdomain=uk) and a big thank you to Metro Bank and all the organisers who made the meetup possible - I'm looking forward to the next one! :tada:
