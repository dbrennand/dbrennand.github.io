I&amp;rsquo;m using it to host various services on VMs and LXC containers. In my setup, I have two external SSDs providing storage, these are connected to my Proxmox node via USB 3.0. However, recently I was experiencing issues with the SSDs suddenly disconnecting from the Proxmox node!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was very frustrating because the VM filesystems that were on these SSDs were becoming corrupted! &amp;#x1f631;
This issue was happening on Proxmox &lt;code>8.1.3&lt;/code> and kernel version &lt;code>6.5.11-7-pve&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
