I&amp;rsquo;m using it to host various services on VMs and LXC containers. In my setup, I have two external SSDs providing storage, these are connected to my Proxmox node via USB 3.0. However, recently I was experiencing issues with the SSDs suddenly disconnecting from the Proxmox node!
This was very frustrating because the VM filesystems that were on these SSDs were becoming corrupted!</description></item></channel></rss>
