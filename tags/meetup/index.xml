The meetup was attended by around 25 people and was hosted at the Dell Technologies offices in London. The meetup was sponsored by Red Hat and Krameff Solutions.
I did my first ever talk at a meetup titled: Infrastructure as Code - VPS provisioning and configuration on Hetzner Cloud. Hetzner is a public cloud provider I&amp;rsquo;ve used for personal projects and in my Homelab.</description></item></channel></rss>
