The meetup was attended by around 25 people and was hosted at the Dell Technologies offices in London. The meetup was sponsored by Red Hat and Krameff Solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did my first ever talk at a meetup titled: &lt;em>Infrastructure as Code - VPS provisioning and configuration on Hetzner Cloud&lt;/em>. Hetzner is a public cloud provider I&amp;rsquo;ve used for personal projects and in my Homelab. I&amp;rsquo;ve been really impressed with their service and the value for money they offer. As part of my talk, I did a live demo of deploying a Virtual Private Server (VPS) and configuring a NGINX web server on the VPS using Ansible. The talk went really well and there was a some great Q&amp;amp;A with the audience &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
