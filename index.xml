&lt;h1 id="what-is-beszel">What is Beszel?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://beszel.dev/">Beszel&lt;/a> is a simple, lightweight server monitoring software which can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. I first heard about Beszel whilst reading the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1eb4bi5/i_just_released_beszel_a_server_monitoring_hub/">&lt;code>/r/selfhosted&lt;/code>&lt;/a> subreddit about a year ago, and a couple of months ago I had time to deploy it in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbrennand/home-ops/tree/main/docker/beszel">Home-Ops&lt;/a> project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beszel consists of two components: the hub and the agent. The hub provides a web interface for visualising the data sent from agents which run on your servers. My Beszel Hub is currently receiving data from 10 systems in my Homelab:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ansible Meetup 5 June 2025</title><link>https://dbren.uk/blog/ansible-meetup-5-june/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 13:49:23 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://dbren.uk/blog/ansible-meetup-5-june/</guid><description>&lt;p>It was another great &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/ansible-london/events/307305041/">Ansible meetup&lt;/a> in London on the 5th June 2025. It was hosted at Metro Bank&amp;rsquo;s offices near Holburn and the attendance was excellent!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I gave a talk titled &lt;em>Ansible 101 - Getting Started on your Ansible Journey&lt;/em>. The talk was aimed at members of the community who&amp;rsquo;re new to Ansible and just starting their Ansible journey.

&lt;p>Back again with another blog post! This time I wanted to discuss some cool changes I&amp;rsquo;ve made in my Homelab to explore AWX and Ansible Execution Environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-awx">What is AWX?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible/awx">AWX&lt;/a> provides a web interface and REST API for managing and running Ansible content. AWX is the upstream project which Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s commerical offering Ansible Automation Platform&amp;rsquo;s Automation Controller is based on. AWX uses Execution Environments to run Ansible content and is deployed on Kubernetes using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator">awx-operator&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ansible Meetup 21 November 2024</title><link>https://dbren.uk/blog/ansible-meetup-21-november/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2024 18:46:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dbren.uk/blog/ansible-meetup-21-november/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had an awesome time at the Ansible Meetup in London on the 21st of November 2024.

&lt;p>I did my first ever talk at a meetup titled: &lt;em>Infrastructure as Code - VPS provisioning and configuration on Hetzner Cloud&lt;/em>. Hetzner is a public cloud provider I&amp;rsquo;ve used for personal projects and in my Homelab. I&amp;rsquo;ve been really impressed with their service and the value for money they offer. As part of my talk, I did a live demo of deploying a Virtual Private Server (VPS) and configuring a NGINX web server on the VPS using Ansible. The talk went really well and there was a some great Q&amp;amp;A with the audience &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Remote access with Tailscale</title><link>https://dbren.uk/blog/tailscale/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:57:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://dbren.uk/blog/tailscale/</guid><description>&lt;p>Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post sitting in a coffee shop, securely routing all my traffic through a device on my home network and have access to all my Homelab services and devices as if I was at home too.

&lt;p>Dev Containers provide a containerised development environment within Visual Studio Code.

Moreover, it helps ease the onboarding process, getting new team members up and running quickly, and helps avoid common issues such as &amp;ldquo;it works on my machine&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;oh, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a different version of x&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fixing Proxmox USB Disconnects</title><link>https://dbren.uk/blog/proxmox-fix-usb-disconnect/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 20:33:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dbren.uk/blog/proxmox-fix-usb-disconnect/</guid><description>&lt;p>Towards the end of last year, I introduced &lt;a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox&lt;/a> into my Homelab.

However, recently I was experiencing issues with the SSDs suddenly disconnecting from the Proxmox node!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was very frustrating because the VM filesystems that were on these SSDs were becoming corrupted! &amp;#x1f631;
This issue was happening on Proxmox &lt;code>8.1.3&lt;/code> and kernel version &lt;code>6.5.11-7-pve&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrating from Google Workspace and Outlook Mail to iCloud+</title><link>https://dbren.uk/blog/google-outlook-to-icloud+/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 09:13:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://dbren.uk/blog/google-outlook-to-icloud+/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="why-im-migrating-from-google-workspace-and-outlook-to-icloud">Why I&amp;rsquo;m Migrating from Google Workspace and Outlook to iCloud+&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>In this blog post we will be looking at building and publishing a container image to GitHub Packages using GitHub Actions!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently revisited an old project of mine; now called &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbrennand/speeder">speeder&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a Python script to monitor your internet speed and send the results to &lt;a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB&lt;/a>. The results can then be visualised in &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbrennand/speeder#docker-compose-stack---influxdb-and-grafana">Grafana&lt;/a>. I originally created this script during the Coronavirus lockdowns whilst internet usage was high and essential for work.

&lt;h2 id="why-do-we-need-to-test-ansible-content">Why do we need to test Ansible content?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Testing is an integral part of the software development lifecycle. It helps identify and prevent bugs from reaching production and in some cases, helps identify performance issues. When creating Ansible content we need to ensure that it works as expected and that we are not introducing any undesired behaviour. This is where Molecule comes in.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Managing Secrets in Ansible</title><link>https://dbren.uk/blog/managing-secrets-in-ansible/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 17:31:31 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://dbren.uk/blog/managing-secrets-in-ansible/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi there! 👋&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As with most automation, we need to use credentials to authenticate to our servers and other applications.

&lt;p>In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about Ansible. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for a little while now and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my experience with it and share some knowledge for others starting out! :slight_smile:&lt;/p>

In this blog post, I will showcase two approaches for storing credentials securely for use in PowerShell scripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="encrypted-password-file-">Encrypted Password File 🔒&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The encrypted password file leverages the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms995355(v=msdn.10)">Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI)&lt;/a> to encrypt the password as a &lt;code>System.Security.SecureString&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$Credentials.Password
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>System.Security.SecureString
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$Credentials.Password | ConvertFrom-SecureString
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>01000000d08c9ddf0115d1118c7a00c04fc297eb01000000f5ab85d7ee9da048ae4ae797ee7eaf0a000000000200000000001066000000010000200000008c4a03d2f0731e0e7661d695fda8b441eaff31e75724931f31374a0c8292b636000000000e800000000200002000000028da885828bd627480178382ce9a1b477819e7703546ce41819d37f4e63d33ba20000000ab2c4401635ec24db9f20071e18dea0b79ce16ba38b5503ec9937b7fbc849dcf40000000155053a793c210998ef7317b0161e7344c2174b904b527c0cf24e7bbf2243b99e936df3ab67bc9e285a1be33aed37c7604fb07f5d0c44ceb7d6334ca30b0a610
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>By default DPAPI uses the current user context to generate an encryption key. This encryption key is then used to encrypt the &lt;code>PSCredential.Password&lt;/code> property as a &lt;code>System.Security.SecureString&lt;/code> (as shown above). It is possible to provide your own encryption key, but I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering that in this post.
